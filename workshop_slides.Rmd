## At the beginning there was a shiny app

---

## Shiny app

Describe Starting point Productive object → shiny app 
Is an existing simple production ready package available on github they can fork.

---

## How to Fork

Instructions to make a fork on GitHub

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## Project structure

The project is a shiny app structured as a package. 

Summary of Vanlog’s workshop main points

---

## Package Structure

*"In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others."*, [Introduction to R packages by Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html)

Such a structure gives us some useful functionalities, such as unit testing and documentation.
Moreover we can rely on  built-in features to automatically check the code (R CMD Check)

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", out.extra='style="position:absolute;bottom:100px;right:50px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/package_structure.png")
```

---

## Production Ready

Being Production Ready means that the product-building process is an automated, streamlined pipeline, optimized for speed of delivery to the end-user.

By automating building and testing processes, the pipeline to production ensures:

  - Security  
  - Quality  
  - Stability  
  
Production is not a fixed object, but a continuous improvement cycle.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%", out.extra='style="position:absolute;bottom:60px;right:50px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/devCycle.001.png")
```

Practical example: Running R CMD Check discover documentation is incomplete (they need to fix it).

---

## Best Practices

Modularize your code. (functions and package structure in R)

Have your building blocks general and flexible.

Make your code robust with automated testing.

Trace your work with a version control system

---

## Version Control

A project under version control records changes over time so that a specific version of the project can be recalled at a later point in time. 

Usually changes are not tracked only locally but on a server to ensure against local failures and to integrate the track changes of multiple developers.

A version control system is the starting point for collaborative work.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", out.extra='style="position:absolute;bottom:50px;right:50px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/git.png")
```

---

## Git

Git Commit

Git Push

Git Pull

---

## Automating Controls

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automatically merging current development work to a shared mainline, also multiple time a day. 

Automating the checks means not having to realy on people applying best practices.

Make an example that looks innocuous but fails. One does not want to rely on people manually running checks before committing.

`R CMD check`

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", out.extra='style="position:absolute;bottom:50px;right:50px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/R-CMD-checks.png")
```

---

## Travis CI

Travis CI is an open-source continuous integration service that can be used to build and test software projects hosted on GitHub.

`usethis::use_travis(ext = "com")` creates a Travis CI configuration file (`.travis.yml`)

```{yaml, eval = FALSE}
language: r
cache: packages
```

To enable Travis CI go to [Travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/) and Sign up with GitHub.

On Travis CI the user needs to select the repositories on which to activate the continuous integration.

Then GitHub notifies Travis CI of the occurrence of new commits / pull requests, triggering actions on Travis CI as specified in .travis.yml

A badge indicating the CI status can be integrated in the `README.md`.

## Gitflow

Collaboration, gitflow. → branches (develop / feature), control development process, work in parallel. 

.pull-left[
[Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is a standard setup that allows a collaborative development, while assuring the safety of the released product.

According to the Gitflow approach, the central repo holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime:

- `master`: branch where source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.
- `develop`: branch where source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered developments for the next release.

Each feature branch provides an additional incremental value to the product, potentially ready for deployment. ]

.pull-right[
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", out.extra='style="position:absolute;bottom:50px;right:50px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/gitflow.png")
```

## New Issues

screenshot on how to make one.
show how to create a branch.
Live: fix issue on the branch --> make a pull request to merge this into the main branch

---

## Pull Requests and branches control

Pull requests control branches. Necessity of controls on pull requests to ensure robustness and stability of the code.

Set restrictions on branches: require review and status check (travis-ci) before merging to master or develop. 
Screenshot on where to set branches controls?

Screenshots to see the checks passibg before merging?

## Agile Development

Gitflow is an Agile framework by nature.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", out.extra='style="position:absolute;bottom:100px;right:50px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/project-board.png")
```

## Deployment shinyapps.io

Setup shinyapp.io → is our productive environment
Manual deployment → check all works

## DevOps

**Goals**
Achieve faster time to production
Enable more frequent deployments
Lower failure rate of new releases
Shorten lead time between fixes
Enhance collaboration between groups


**Challenges**
Mindset and Culture
Security
Responsibility


**Benefits**
Development via small work items increases the speed of development and improves its quality.
Slow, repetitive and human made actions are error-prone. Automation in testing and deployment increases the stability of the production process.
Version controlled development ensures traceability and repeatability of the development.
Collaboration and an agile approach are keys to a functional production pipeline.
Building, testing and deploying discrete development components improve confidence in the final product.


Note:
Infrastructure can also follow a continuous delivery philosophy (Infrastructure as Code).

**DevOps is a culture. Tools can enable it.**


```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", out.extra='style="position:absolute;bottom:100px;right:50px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/devops.001.png")
```

## Automatic Deployment

Part of DevOps is to streamline the deployment process. This can be done as automatic / continuous deployment via GitHub Actions.

## Release

A Release is the deployment to production of a specific chunck of development. Each  new release determines a new version (minor or major) of the software.

According to the Gitflow approach, no work should be pushed directly to `master`, which is updated as part of a release with a pull request from a stable `develop` branch or a `release` branch.

**How to do a release**

Create a release branch (e.g. `release/v2.0.0`) from `develop`.

Consolidate the changelog (`NEWS.md` in R, see e.g. [recommendations](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html#important-files) and [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html#news-release)).

Example

```
1.0.0 release preps
- Closes #XYZ Updated report.
```

Update package version (NEWS.md and DESCRIPTION files in R).

Create and merge a new pull request release/v2.0.0 →  master,  where the `closes XXX` are in the pull request comment.

Create a new release tag on master (on [GitHub Code > releases > Draft new release](https://github.com/miraisolutions/SmaRP/releases/new)).
  - Tag version: v1.0.1
  - Release title: packagename 1.0.1
  - Body: Paste as comment the list of changes in `NEWS.md`
  - Click on "Publish release"

Create a new pull request and merge release/v2.0.0  →  develop

Prepare for next version on develop (by changing the version NEWS.md and DESCRIPTION files).
