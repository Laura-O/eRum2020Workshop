# Abstract

## Bring your R Application Safely to Production. Collaborate, Deploy, Automate.

If you are looking for a hands-on introduction to CI/CD pipelines with a
structured approach to collaborative development, this is the workshop
you are looking for. To get your head around pull requests and branches,
travis.yml files, workflows and processes for controlled development and
deployments using free open source tools, all you need is your laptop
(with R 3.6.x, RStudio and Git installed), a GitHub account and joining
us.

In this hands-on 3-hours session we will:

  - highlight the benefits of versioning your R code with Git and
    GitHub;
  - show how to set up automated controls of your development on Travis
    CI, leveraging unit tests and R’s built-in package checks for
    Continuous Integration (CI);
  - discuss effective branching models, pull requests and branch
    protection on GitHub, an approach especially important in a
    collaborative environment;
  - demonstrate how to set up Continuous Deployment (CD) of packaged
    applications via Travis CI/GitHub Actions.

A simple R package with a Shiny app will be used as a running example to
lay out a full workflow for stable, secure, reproducible deployments and
releases.

This workshop is the natural continuation of “Is R ready for Production?
Let’s develop a Professional Shiny Application\!”, however, attendance
to the previous workshop is not a mandatory prerequisite.

## Session format

or advanced R topic.
